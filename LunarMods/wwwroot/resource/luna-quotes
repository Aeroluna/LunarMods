Oh, most wonderful of nights.
Rest, my sister. As always, I will guard the night.
Who goes there?
Did I miss anything?
A warm welcome to you.
I am the princess of the night, thus it is my duty to come into your dreams.
It is time to face your real fears.
Sometimes we can worry about a thing so much, the fear can make us feel we're trapped in a nightmare.
I see much of myself in you, and I can tell you from personal experience that things do indeed get better.
I always knew that whatever adversity you faced, you would find your way through it.
